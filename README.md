# Social Intelligence

Utilities & scripts to collect and find insight from social network data.

Store a local cache of data from social media sites in a Postgres database for
analysis. Report on interesting trends, user patterns, etc..

## Get Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Get a Postgres database running
3. Dive into the platform-specific directories (only Reddit for now, others soon?)
4. Expect a ./collect and ./report each with their own set of Python dependencies you should install
5. Run some scripts under ./collect ... then check out what's available under ./report

## Where are we going with this?

There's a lot of messy code that should be cleaned up and uploaded as this
collection progresses. Check back soon.
